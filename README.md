# Bespa: Challenging benchmarks for testing deep reinforcement learning algorithms under sparse rewards
This repository contains several sparse-reward environments useful for testing DRL algorithms under a diverse set of demanding situations.
Currently, the following domains are found here:
- VizDoom MyWayHome + broken TV (no actions - random transitions)
- VizDoom MyWayHome + noisy TV (one switch action - random transitions)
- VizDoom MyWayHome + sasr TV (one switch action - deterministic statically-rendered transitions)
- VizDoom MyWayHome + madr TV (four switch actions - deterministic dinamically-rendered transitions)
